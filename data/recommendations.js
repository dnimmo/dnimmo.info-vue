He is an advocate of TDD, device-agnostic development and choosing the right technologies for the job, rather than blindly choosing tools he already knows. He is passionate about development and clearly has a deep understanding of both the key concepts and language specific nuances. He is usually the first member the team go to with any JavaScript queries or strange behaviour.",
      "He is committed to always improving and, again, improving those around him, and has recommended new technology to the team (always backed up with sound reason) and given talks on concepts such as functional programming.",

David was in a senior position on the team when I first started at DWP and from day one he was excellent in this capacity. Coming into an existing team can be a daunting experience (especially for someone with a background in a different programming language) but from the outset he made me feel welcome and empowered. On day one he asked me to perform a code review on the existing codebase and although I was unfamiliar with the technoligies involved, he took my comments on board without ego and ensured that we acted upon them collaboratively as a team.",
        "It is obvious that David has very strong technical skills. During my time spent with him he was the team's best resource on NodeJS and associated technologies. He is passionate about web development and is always increasing his knowledge through personal projects and online learning. He introduced me to the principles of functional programming and has an obvious understanding of its correct usage and the benefits involved. He is eager to explore new languages and techniques, so much so that attempting to list all of the languages and tools he has knowledge of here would take a long time!",
        "David would be an extremely valuable member of any team, through both his technical and non-technical skills. He has always been eager to help colleagues to progress their technical experience through recommendations of software development practice, thorough but pragmatic code reviews, and healthy debate amongst the team. He promotes the use of valuable software development practices such as peer reviews, agile development and pair programming. It's clear that he understands the benefits of these practises and knows how to best utilise them.",
        "Technical skills aside, David is a key member of any project team. He has a great personality; he is easy to get on with, approachable and willing to help. He is not afraid to voice an opinion if it's for the good of the project, even if he's in the minority. At the same time he is open to hearing opposing opinions and eager to reach a consensus as a team. David has strong leadership qualities and is looked up to by other team members. He is great at identifying and describing any concerns about a task to technical and non-technical people alike, and helps to steer a project, task, or meeting if it's getting off track.",
        "He has been a very positive influence on the team and myself personally during the time I've spent working with him. I would love to work with him again and would definitely recommend him to anyone considering hiring him."
